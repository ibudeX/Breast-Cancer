## üîç Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

### 1. Data Cleaning
- Handled missing values in `LoanAmount`, `Credit_History`, and `Self_Employed`.
- Standardized categorical values.
- Converted numerical data types for analysis.

### 2. Univariate Analysis
- Distribution of applicant income and loan amount.
- Loan approval ratio by gender, marital status, and property area.

## üí° Key Insights

- **Credit history** is the strongest determinant of loan approval. Applicants with a good credit history have an approval rate above 80%.
- **Applicant income** positively correlates with loan approval but with diminishing returns above a certain threshold.
- **Self-employed individuals** face slightly lower approval rates, suggesting potential bias or risk-based restrictions.
- **Urban areas** show the highest loan approvals and average income.
- **Applicants with dependents** tend to request higher loans but have lower approval rates.

## üß≠ Recommendations

1. **Credit Scoring Priority:**  
   Give higher weight to credit history in the loan approval model.

2. **Targeted Financial Products:**  
   Offer special loan packages for **self-employed** applicants with strong income consistency.

3. **Income-based Risk Profiling:**  
   Introduce tiered loan limits to manage exposure among low-income applicants.

4. **Rural Loan Incentives:**  
   Provide rural applicants with lower-interest micro-loans to increase inclusion.

5. **Customer Education:**  
   Educate applicants on how to build and maintain good credit histories.
